            Supervision Compliance Motivators

          <p>
            People who have not had a lot of experience with the Justice System are eager to put probation behind them and afraid of getting out of compliance.

            Supervision Compliance Weak Points

          <p>
            Some individuals have effectively become “numbed” to their criminal record due to their extensive criminal history or criminal justice system experiences.

            Assist in the pursuit of personal goals in parallel to completing supervision requirements.

            Incentivise compliance by making them eligible for a lottery to refund some of the supervision fees already paid.
