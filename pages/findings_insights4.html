            Individualized Support
          </h3>
          <p>
            Support Staff engage with clients in way that build rapport and gain trust with clients in a different but  complementary way to case managers, because their roles are not strictly compliance focused.

            Jail Issues

            There is a need to support people to  keep their life together while they are incarcerated.
          </p>
          <p>
            Some people not eligible for pretrial or other out of jail options because of their risk level, the type of crime they committed or for not having a stable address or phone number or references.

            Target low risk low need offenders with online supervision tools. Less interaction with them is better for successful.
