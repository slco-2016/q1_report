            Individualized Support
          </h3>
          <p>
            Support staff engage with clients in way that build rapport and gain trust with clients in a different but  complementary way to case managers, because their roles are not strictly compliance focused.

            Jail Issues
          </h3>
          <p>
            There is a need to provide support for individuals in terms of their home life as well as maintaining key components of stability while they are incarcerated. By addressing issues such as car payments, rent, and other "everyday" responsibility, clients will be better prepared upon release to focus on succeeding with regards to both their release requirements, as well as their personal life.
          </p>
          <p>
            Circumstances can deteriorate quickly for high-risk individuals who must remain incarcerated or who aren’t eligible for pretrial services. Their increased needs must be addressed.

          <p>
            Target low risk low need offenders with online supervision tools. Less interaction with them is better for successful.
